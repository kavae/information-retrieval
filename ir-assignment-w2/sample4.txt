The Scary: Artificial intelligence is influencing our decision making
"We are already facing the negative outcomes of AI. For example, take recommendation algorithms for streaming services: the types of shows you see are influenced by the shows recommended to you by an artificial agent. More generally, today's AI systems influence human decision making at multiple levels: from viewing habits to purchasing decisions, from political opinions to social values. To say that the consequences of AI is a problem for future generations ignores the reality in front of us — our everyday lives are already being influenced. Artificial intelligence — in its current form — is largely unregulated and unfettered. Companies and institutions are free to develop the algorithms that maximize their profit, their engagement, their impact. I don't worry about some dystopian future; I worry about the reality we have right now, and how we integrate the amazing possibilities of artificial intelligence into human-centered systems.”
